# »genesis - v1« patch version  (2024)




Genesis v1 - generative version is a first example of input-free generation with neural networks. Instead of relying on data extracted from human practices, genesis instead intends to amplify and overmultiply the internal materiality of several neural networks, offering a strange encounter with a self-listening system of four generative agents that have been designed without any external input. This patch version allow the user to freely interact with the system, or let the system behave in its very own way.
