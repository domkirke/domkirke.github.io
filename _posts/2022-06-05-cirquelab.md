Le Cirque Ã‰lectrique welcomes, for the 2022 Edition of the Cirques Laboratoires, the <div class="tooltip">ACIDS <span class="tooltiptext">Artificial & Creative Intelligence and Data Science</span> </div> team (alongside with the <div class="tooltip">ISMM team<span class="tooltiptext">Interaction, Sound, Music, Movement</span> </div>) of IRCAM and students from the Centre national des Arts du Cirque Chalons-en-Champagne. Created since the early beginnings of the Cirque Electric since 1995, Cirque Laboratoire proposes musical improvisation along with circus performances, and then becomes a place for openness and curiosity. <br/>
For this show : dance, motion capture, trapeze, neural synthesis, German wheel, industrial techno, acrobratic lift, gazing soundscapes, Chinese pole, all of this blended together during a flash 2-days work session.
