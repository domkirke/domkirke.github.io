<emph style="font-weight: 600; display: inline;">ACIDS Workshop Alpha</emph> is the first occurence of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ACIDS Workshop</span> series of concerts, aiming to foster research & creation around collaborative AI music generation. This show is a first of its kind to focus on IA-generated live music, bridging the research done @ IRCAM and improvised / experimental / techno music.

<h1>Forme improvisée en trio pour flugabone, trombone et dispositif électroacoustique</h1>
<h2>Maxime Mantovani, Antoine Caillon, Victor Auffray, Jules Boitin</h2>
<p>Collaborative and participative improvisation project around instrumental gesture with electro-acoustic sights. Maxime Mantovani, electro-acoustic music composer, adapt its interfaces to be specially played through a dialog with instrumentalists. Following an IRCAM residency within ACIDS team, he uses the novel real-time generative models developed by Antoine Caillon during a trio with Victor Aufray (flugabone) and Jules Boitin (trombone).</p>

<h1>no-op violation</h1>
<h2>Ninon Devis, Philippe Esling</h2>
<p>No-op does nothing. If No-op is not implemented as a specific instruction on your target architecture, the assembler treats it as a pseudo-instruction and generates an alternative instruction that does nothing.
No-op is not necessarily a time-consuming No-op. The processor might remove it.

<h1>aletheia</h1>
<h2>Axel Chemla--Romeu-Santos</h2>
<p>Aletheia is an audio-visual piece based on exploring, transforming, hacking, bending, and interplaying with audio and image generative models. Referring to the pre-socratic notion of ἀλήθεια, this piece illustrates the discovery of reality by going from phenomenological pure perception artifacts to an imitation game, yielding to a deranging and coercive version of reality.
