# Inception Ghosts [1st generation]

Inception ghosts [1st generation] is an experiment of generative reverse engineering, trying to pump back ghostly images from the Inception-v3 image classification model. An initially empty generator learns to classification scores obtains with its generation, yielding abstract images that are paradoxically maximizing the inception score of the classification model.
