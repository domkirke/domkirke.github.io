# »genesis - v1«  (2023)
## for no-input AI neural generators


genesis - v1 is a first attempt of using audio generative neural networks without the resort to any human data, amplifying the own materiality of the algorithms towards cybernetic chaos rather than nature imitation. While the use of neural generative modelling for reproduction becomes invasive in our lives, their specific materiality is largely unknown, unshown, and even hidden, as if its revelation would be the unveilement of a magic trick. However, what could happen if we take the opposite position, that is enforcing individuality and emergence away from any human data and judgements? While learning without data can seem non-sense, I tried to overcome this apparent paradox by rather by giving to a set of different agents and set of structural (and often impossible) objectives, to force them to find the genesis of an eco-systemic equilibrium with which I communicate during the performance through diverse inputs (request, bending, recording).
